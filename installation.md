# Getting started

To use clangd, you need:
 - clangd installed
 - a plugin for your editor
 - to tell clangd how your project is built

## Installing clangd

Most distributions include clangd in a `clang-tools` package, or in the full
`llvm` distribution.

- **Debian/Ubuntu:** `sudo apt-get install clang-tools`
- **Mac:** `brew install llvm`
- **Windows:** Download LLVM from [releases.llvm.org](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

`clangd --version` should print `clangd version 7.0.0` or later.

## Editor plugins

Language Server plugins are available for many editors. In principle clangd
should work with any of them, though feature set and interface may vary.

Here are some plugins we know work well with clangd:

<summary markdown="span">Vim</summary>
[LanguageClient-neovim](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim)
  has [instructions for using clangd](https://github.com/autozimu/LanguageClient-neovim/wiki/Clangd).

We're working on making clangd work with YouCompleteMe: [Valloric/ycmd/issues/1114](https://github.com/Valloric/ycmd/issues/1114)
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Emacs</summary>
[lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) supports clangd. You'll
probably want to install `flycheck`, `lsp-ui`, and `company-mode`.

[eglot](https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot) can be configured to work with clangd.

<summary markdown="span">Visual Studio Code</summary>
[vscode-clangd](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd) can be installed from within VSCode.

[tomv564/LSP](https://github.com/tomv564/LSP) works with clangd out of the box.

If you don't have strong feelings about an editor, we suggest you try out
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it has excellent language server
support and most faithfully demonstrates what clangd can do.

## Project setup

To understand your source code, clangd needs to know your build flags.
(This is just a fact of life in C++, source files are not self-contained).

By default, clangd will assume your code is built as `clang some_file.cc`,
and you'll probably get spurious errors about missing `#include`d files, etc.
There are a couple of ways to fix this.

### `compile_commands.json`

This file provides compile commands for every source file in a project.
It is usually generated by tools.
Clangd will look in the parent directories of the files you edit looking for it.

<details>
<summary markdown="span">CMake-based projects</summary>
If your project builds with CMake, it can generate this file. You should enable
it with:

```cmake -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=1```

`compile_commands.json` will be written to your build directory.
You should symlink it (or simply copy it) to the root of your source tree, if
they are different.

```ln -s ~/myproject/compile_commands.json ~/myproject-build/```
</details>

<details>
<summary markdown="span">Other build systems, using Bear</summary>
[Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) is a tool to generate a
compile_commands.json file by recording a complete build.

For a `make`-based build, you can run `make clean; bear make` to generate the
file (and run a clean build!).
</details>

Other tools can also generate this file. See [the compile_commands.json
specification](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html).

### `compile_flags.txt`

If all files in a project use the same build flags, you can put those
flags one-per-line in `compile_flags.txt` in your source root.

Clangd will assume the compile command is `clang $FLAGS some_file.cc`.

Creating this file by hand is a reasonable place to start if your project is
quite simple.
